# California Temperature and Precipitation Data (2001–2023)

This repository provides long-term monthly climate data for California, including minimum temperature, maximum temperature, and total precipitation from 2001 to 2023. These datasets support environmental monitoring, climate trend analysis, and resource management studies in the western United States.

## Data Description

- `temp_min.xls`: Monthly minimum temperature (°C)
- `temp_max.xls`: Monthly maximum temperature (°C)
- `precipitation.xls`: Monthly total precipitation (mm)

All files contain statewide aggregated monthly values.
